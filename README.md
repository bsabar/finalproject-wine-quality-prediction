# Demystifying ML - Wine Quality Prediction Final Project

## Description 
Final Group Project to work together to solve, analyze or visualize a problem using machine learning (ML) with the other technologies learned. The group decided to work on predicting wine quality and wanted to answer the following questions.

- Which chemical factors have the biggest impact on wine quality?
- Which chemical factors have the least impact on wine quality?
- Use the machine learning model to predict wine quality based on user-imputed factors.

## Tools Used
- `Python Pandas`
- `Python Matplotlib`
- `Javascript`
- `HTML`
- `JS Plotly`
- `Seaborn`
- `ML Models`

## Data Sources
|Name|Type|Description|Website|
|---|---|---|---|
|Wine Quality|CSV|Two datasets related to red and white vinho verde wine samples from the North of Portugal|[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)|
|Spanish Wine Quality Dataset |CSV|This dataset is related to red variants of Spanish wines. The dataset describes several popularity and description metrics and their effect on its quality.|https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/spanish-wine-quality-dataset|

## Data & Data Delivery
- Used `python pandas` and `python pathlib` to import and load the data in DataFrame
- Used `delimiter` to separate each column neatly 
- Added new “color” columns to distinguish each dataset 
- Merge the two datasets together
- Utilize `pd.get_dummies` for converting categorical variables into a set of binary columns to differentiate the wine color
- Utilize `insull().sum()` in order to check the dataset for any null values

## Machine Learning 



## Visualization

- The project's web page is structured using HTML and Bootstrap for styling.
- We used javascript to set images and the descriptions.
- CSS was used to adjust the style.
